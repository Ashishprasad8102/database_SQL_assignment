    "1> A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for\n",
    "efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Databases are used in various applications and systems to \n",
    "store, manage, and retrieve data for different purposes. They are crucial in modern software development\n",
    "and are the backbone of many web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Model: SQL databases follow the relational model, which means data is organized into tables \n",
    "with predefined schemas. Each table represents a specific entity, and rows in the table represent \n",
    "individual records\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means the structure of the tables and the relationships\n",
    "between them are defined in advance. Any changes to the schema require careful planning and migration to\n",
    "maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform operations like inserting,\n",
    "updating, deleting, and retrieving data. SQL is a powerful language for working with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Properties: SQL databases typically adhere to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,\n",
    "Durability) to ensure data integrity and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Relational Model: NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not adhere to the traditional relational\n",
    "model. They come in various forms, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases,\n",
    "each optimized for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-flexible: NoSQL databases are often schema-flexible or schema-less, meaning each record can have \n",
    "its own structure without requiring a predefined schema. This flexibility allows for easier evolution of\n",
    "data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying: NoSQL databases often have their query languages, which might be less powerful than SQL but \n",
    "are tailored to work well with specific data models. Some NoSQL databases also support SQL-like querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability in mind, making it easier to\n",
    "distribute data across multiple nodes or servers to handle large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases often emphasize either Consistency, Availability, or Partition Tolerance\n",
    "(CAP Theorem) rather than providing all three guarantees simultaneously.\n",

    "2>DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language,\" which is a subset of SQL used to define and manage\n",
    "the structure of a database. DDL commands are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting\n",
    "database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. They are essential for defining\n",
    "the database schema and its organization. Let's explain the usage of four primary DDL commands\n",
    "with examples:\n",
    "    CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. Here's an example of creating a table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "In this example, we are creating a table named \"employees\" with four columns: \"id,\" \"name,\" \"age,\" and \"department.\" The \"id\" column is set as the primary key, ensuring uniqueness for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP command is used to remove database objects like tables, indexes, or views. Here's an example of dropping the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "This command will completely remove the \"employees\" table and all its associated data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, you can use it to add, modify, or delete columns in a table. Here's an example of adding a new column to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "This command will add a new column named \"salary\" with a data type of DECIMAL(10, 2) to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table but retains the table structure. It is a faster alternative to the DELETE command when you want to empty a table completely. However, note that TRUNCATE does not log individual row deletions, making it non-recoverable. Here's an example of truncating the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "This command will remove all rows from the \"employees\" table, but the table structure will remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that DDL commands can have significant consequences on the database schema and data. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution when using them and to have proper backups and data migration strategies in place.\n",

    "3> ML stands for Data Manipulation Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that\n",
    "allows users to manipulate data stored in a relational database. The primary operations in DML are INSERT,\n",
    "UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to add, modify, and remove data from database tables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT statement is used to add new records (rows) into a database table. It allows you to specify \n",
    "the values to be inserted into each column for the new row. The basic syntax of the INSERT statement\n",
    "is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)\n",
    "VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say we have a table called \"Employees\" with columns \"EmployeeID,\" \"FirstName,\" \"LastName,\" and\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)\n",
    "VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', 'Sales');\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a database table. It allows you to change\n",
    "the values of one or more columns for one or more rows based on a specified condition. The basic\n",
    "syntax of the UPDATE statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "UPDATE table_name\n",
    "SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say we want to update the department of employee ID 101 to \"Marketing,\" we can use the UPDATE statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Employees\n",
    "SET Department = 'Marketing'\n",
    "WHERE EmployeeID = 101;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a database table based on a specified condition.\n",
    "Be careful when using this statement, as it permanently removes data from the table. The basic syntax of the\n",
    "DELETE statement is as follows:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DELETE FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say we want to delete the employee with ID 101 from the \"Employees\" table, we can use the DELETE \n",
    "statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE EmployeeID = 101;\n",
    "Remember, DML statements should be used with caution, especially the UPDATE and DELETE operations,\n",
    "as they can have a significant impact on the data in your database. Always make sure to have proper\n",
    "backups and double-check your conditions before executing these statements.\n"
